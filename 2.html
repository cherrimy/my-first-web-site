    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language for describing how to display documents written in HTML or XML (including XML dialect SVG, XHTML). CSS specifies how elements should be rendered on a screen, paper, voice, or other medium. CSS is one of the core languages of the open web, and the W3C specification operates as a standard for various browsers. In the past, various parts of the CSS specification were developed sequentially, so it was possible to attach versions like CSS1, CSS2.1, and CSS3. However, the official version will not go up to CSS4. After CSS3, as the scope of the CSS specification has expanded dramatically, the difference between the different CSS modules has become too large. So it is now more effective to develop and publish recommendations on a per-module basis. Now, W3C does not upload a version of the CSS specification, but instead periodically takes snapshots of the CSS specification stabilizer.
